      <div>  Police on Monday sought an arrest warrant for Jung Joon-young, a singer and popular TV personality, on charges of secretly filming sex tapes of women and sharing them with his friends on a mobile chat.

The police also requested the prosecution to apply for a writ against a nightclub staff, identified only by his last name Kim, over the same charge, according to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency handling the case.

Jung, 30, is accused of recording the sex videos of about 10 women he slept with and uploading them on a KakaoTalk messenger chat room to share them with other entertainers, including Seungri, a member of K-pop boy band BIGBANG.

Seungri has also been investigated over the sex tapes and a slew of other charges that include arranging escort services for prospective investors.

Jung has been questioned twice by the police, on Thursday and Sunday.       </div>
